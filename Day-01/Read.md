    <h2>Welcome to the Network Setup Guide! This guide will help you understand the basics of IP addresses, classes, public and private IPs, and how to configure them for different environments.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Understanding IP Addresses</li>
        <li> In any network setup, devices communicate with each other using IP addresses. There are two types of IP addresses:</li>
        <li>IPv4: Shorter addresses, like phone numbers for devices.</li>
        <li>IPv6: Longer addresses, similar to phone numbers but with more digits.</li>
        <li>IP Address Ranges:
            <p>IPv4 addresses range from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. They are divided into five classes: A, B, C, D, and E.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
        <ul>
        <li>Class A: 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255</li>
        <li>Class B: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255</li>
        <li>Class B: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255</li>
        <li>Class C: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255</li>
        <li>Classes D and E are reserved for specific purposes and not commonly used.</li>    
    </ul>
